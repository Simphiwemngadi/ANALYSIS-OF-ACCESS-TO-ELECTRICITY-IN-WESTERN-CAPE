## Project Overview

This project analyzes household access to electricity in the Western Cape, South Africa, using data from Statistics South Africa’s Community Survey 2016.

The study explores how socio-economic and demographic factors influence access to electricity, highlighting disparities across population groups, dwelling types, and geographic areas.

## Objectives

- Analyze household electricity access in the Western Cape

- Examine the relationship between electricity access and socio-economic factors

- Identify vulnerable household groups with limited access

## Research Question

How do socio-economic factors affect household access to electricity in the Western Cape?

## Data Source

- Statistics South Africa (Stats SA)

- Community Survey 2016

- Cross-sectional household data

## Methodology
### Data Preparation

- Data cleaning and recoding of variables
- Creation of a household electricity access variable:
  1. Eskom electricity
  2. Other electricity sources
  3. No access to electricity
- Unspecified responses treated as missing values
 
## Statistical Analysis

- Descriptive Statistics
- Chi-Square Tests of Independence to assess relationships between:
  - Gender of household head
  - Population group of household head
  - Main dwelling type
  - Geographical type (urban/farm)
  - District and metropolitan municipality
## Variables Used
 
| Variable                           | Type        |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Gender of household head           | Categorical |
| Population group of household head | Categorical |
| Main dwelling type                 | Categorical |
| Geographical type                  | Categorical |
| District / Municipality            | Categorical |
| Household electricity access       | Categorical |

## Key Findings

- 96.5% of households had access to electricity provided by Eskom

- 2.6% of households had no access to electricity

- Higher lack of access observed among:
  - Black African-headed households
  - Informal and traditional dwellings
  - Farm areas
  - West Coast and Cape Winelands districts

- Chi-square results (p < 0.05) indicate statistically significant relationships between socio-economic factors and electricity access

## Conclusion

Despite high overall electricity coverage in the Western Cape, clear disparities remain.
Socio-economic characteristics significantly influence household electricity access, highlighting the need for targeted policy interventions to promote equitable access and improve quality of life.
